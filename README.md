# Support-Vector-Machine
Introduction To Support Vector Machine. 
Includes both support vector machine theory as well as SVM coded from scratch and an example each for SVM and kernel SVM.

# Bank notes authenticity:
Bank notes authenticity prediction model based on linear SVM algorithm.

# KernelSVM_IRIS:
Plant category prediction model built on the famous Iris dataset based on polynomial, gaussian and sigmoid kernel SVM.

# SVM from Scratch:
Basic SVM model built from scatch to better understand how SVM works mathematically.

# Support Vector Machine THEORY:
As the name suggests, contains basic mathematical and theoritical concepts related to SVM.
